# Algorithmic Trading
This repository contains three ways to obtain arbitrage:
- Dual Listing Arbitrage
- Options Arbitrage
- Statistical Arbitrage

These are projects in collaboration with [Optiver](https://www.optiver.com/) and have been peer-reviewed by staff 
members of Optiver. Therefore, much of the analysis are correct and give an indication how these methods work.

Please note that these methods can only be effective when written in C++ as speed is of utmost performance. Next to 
that it requires a lightning fast connection (talking in nanoseconds) which is not feasible for the retail investor. 
Any profits made by using these strategies is therefore by pure chance.

I suggest using my [FinanceDatabase](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase) to do fundamental analysis and base 
your investment decisions on that since it has proven to be profitable.
